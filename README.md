# DATA SCIENCE PORTFOLIO

Repository containing portfolio of data science projects completed by me for academic, self learning, and hobby purposes. Presented in the form of iPython Notebooks, and R markdown files.

Note: Data used in the projects (accessed under data directory) is for demonstration purposes only.

## Instructions for Running Python Notebooks Locally

1.  Install dependencies using requirements.txt.
2.  Run notebooks as usual by using a jupyter notebook server, Vscode etc.
